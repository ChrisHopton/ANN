# Artifical Neural Network

This is an implemention of a multilayer ANN in python. This project is a test to show the effects of different learning rates, weight decay rates, hidden layer size, and input size. 

This project currently has a singular hidden layer hard coded in (Maybe I'll functionality for multiple hidden layers). The goal of this project is to implement ANN's from scratch using only necessary libraries such as numpy. This allows the conceptual background of networks become recognizable.
